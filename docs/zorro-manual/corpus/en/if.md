if .. else


## if (comparison) { ... }


## else {  ... }


If the [comparison](comparisions.htm) or expression between the round brackets
is **true** or non-zero, all commands between the first pair
of winged brackets are executed. Otherwise all commands between the second pair of winged brackets following **else**
will be executed. The **else**
  part with the second set of commands can be omitted.
   The winged
  brackets can be omitted when only one instruction is to be executed dependent
  on the comparison.

### Example:


```
if (((x+3)<9) or (y==0))   *// set z to 10 if x+3 is below 9, or if y is equal to 0*
  z = 10;
else
  z = 5;*// set z to 5 in all other cases*
```
