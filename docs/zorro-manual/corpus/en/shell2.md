# Evaluation Shell: Adapting a Strategy


This tutorial section deals with the modifications of a strategy for integrating the
[evaluatien shell](shell.htm). Depending on what you want to do and
which tests you want to apply, there are several steps of integration. We'll use
[workshop6](tutorial_kelly.htm) as an example.

### Step 1: Attaching the shell


For adding cluster analysis, Montecarlo analysis, oversampling, various
walk-forward optimization methods, and different training objectives, you only
need to insert two lines to an existing stragey. Include **
eval.h** at the begin of the script:

```
#include <eval.h>
```


... and **eval.c** at the end:

```
#include <eval.c>
```


You can find a script with attached shell in **Workshop6a**. When you start it, the [Result] button
will change to [Start],
a new menu will be available under [Action], and the
[variables panel](shell.htm) with the system section will pop up:


The settings have only effect when your script does not set those parameters itself. If it does, the script
	will override all
	settings in the panel, except for the
	**_WFO_Cycles** and **_WFO_OOS** values. They override
	the script, since they are used for the cluster analysis.


The default values of some variables can be set up in the strategy script by
**#define** statements. Example:

```
#define _ASSETLIST	"AssetsFix"
#define _BAR_PERIOD     240
#define _LOOKBACK_BARS  4000
#define _WFO_CYCLES     16
#define _BACKTEST_START 20150101
#define _BACKTEST_END   20251231
#define _INVESTMENT 	4

```


The Action menu contains only a subset of the shell
functions. You can Reset the variables, run
Cluster Analysis and Montecarlo
analysis, and open the download page to Download
History.
 

### Step 2: Creating jobs


The next step of evalution is letting the shell control your script variables.
This allows you to experiment with many different parameter settings and optimization
ranges,
and testing them all in an automated process. Any such variant is a 'job'. As a side benefit, putting script variables in a panel also allows you to
observe their bar-to-bar behavior with the [Visual Debugger](chart.htm).


Instead of **eval.h**, now include **
evars.h** at the begin of the script:

```
#include <evars.h>
```


Below the **#include** statement, put all relevant script
variables that you want to observe, optimize, or experiment with in a list. Add comments
and put an
**END_OF_VARS** statement at the end of the list. Example (from
**Workshop6b**):

```
var CNTR_BPPeriod; *//= 30, 20..40, 5; Bandpass period in bars
*var CNTR_BPWidth; *//= 0.5, 0.2..1; Bandpass width
*var CNTR_FisherPeriod; *//=500, 300..700; Fisher transform period
*var CNTR_Threshold; *//= 1,0.5..1.5,0.1; Bandpass threshold*
var CNTR_Fisher; *//= 500,300..500; Time frame of Fisher transform*
var CNTR_TrailDist; *//=4, 0..10; Distance factor for trailing*
var TRND_Mode; *//= 0, 0..1; 0 - Lowpass, 1 - Butterworth filter*
var TRND_Detect; *//= 0, 0..1; 0 - MMI, 1 - Hurst*
var TRND_LPPeriod; *//= 300,100..700,50; Lowpass/Butterworth period in bars*
var TRND_MMIPeriod; *//= 300,100..500; MMI/Hurst Filter time period*
var StopDist; *//= 10,5..30,5; Stop distance in ATR units*
var ATRPeriod; *//=100, 30..150; ATR period for stop/trail distances
*END_OF_VARS
```


This encapsulates the variables in a [C struct](structs.htm)
named **V**. Thus, in the script the variables are accessed with a preceding **V.**,
for instance **V.ATRPeriod**. They all must be of type **var**. It you need an integer variable,
as in a switch/case statement, use an **(int)** typecast. Replace
all your
[optimize](optimize.htm) calls with **_optimize** and
pass the variable as sole parameter. Example:

```
Stop = _optimize(V.StopDist) * ATR(V.ATRPeriod);
```


The added script variables appear at the end with a blue background. For
illustrating the process, we have added two new variables to workshop 6 for
selecting between two market regime detectors (**Hurst** and
**MMI**) and two filters (**Lowpass** and
**Butterworth**). The variable names and the comments matter.
Observe the following rules:


- If the variable belongs exclusively to a certain algo, let its name
	begin with the algo name (f.i. **TRND_Mode**). Otherwise it is
	assumed that the variable is common for all algos.

- The default value is given with **'= value'** in the
	comment. If omitted, the variable is set to **0**.

- If the variable is to be limited by a range, enter it with **'min..max'**
	following a comma after the default value.

- If the variable is to be optimized, enter the **step width**
	following a comma after the range. If the step width is **0**,
	the variable is not optimized, even if it appears in an **_optimize**
	call in the script. In this way, different jobs can optimize different
	variables.

- After the default value or range, enter a semicolon **';'**
	and then a short description of the variable.


The startup panel will now look like this (**Workshop6b**):


The Action menu allows now to save and load jobs,
browse among jobs, and rearrange the [summary report](shell.htm). Experiment with different variable settings and save them to the **Jobs**
folder (or any other folder). Load all of them with Load
Multiple Jobs. Four example jobs from workshop 6 are included, but you
normally have a lot more jobs for thorougly testing a strategy,


When you click [Start] after loading one or
multiple jobs, they are all trained. At the end of the process, a bell will
ring, and the
summary report will open in the editor. If an entry of a particular job already existed
in the summary, it is updated with
the new results. The jobs with the best performances are sorted at the top of the
summary.
 

### Step 3: Creating multiple variants


For finding out which asset, algo, and time frame combinations work best with
which job, test it with any combination. Since this interferes with your
asset/algo loops (if any) in the script, it has to be modified further:


First, put all assets, algos, and timeframes you want to test in **
#define** **_ASSETS**, **_ALGOS**, **
_TIMEFRAMES** statements:

```
 #define _ASSETS "EUR/USD","USD/JPY"
#define _ALGOS "TRND","CNTR"
#define _TIMEFRAMES 60,240  *// in minutes*
```


The syntax is the same as in a [loop](loop.htm) statement, so you
can also use the **Assets** keyword to include all assets from the
current asset list. Next, replace your main asset and algo loops with a single **assetLoop()**
call. Assume your **run** function previously looked like this:

```
function rum()
{
  BarPeriod = 60;
  LookBack = 2000;

  while(asset(loop("EUR/USD","USD/JPY")))
  while(algo(loop("TRND","CNTR")))
  {
    if(strstr(Algo,"TRND")) {
      TimeFrame = 1;
      tradeTrend();
    } else if(strstr(Algo,"CNTR")) {
      TimeFrame = 4;
      tradeCounterTrend();
    }
  }
}
```


It now becomes this (see **workshop6c.c**):

```
 #define _ASSETS "EUR/USD","USD/JPY"
#define _ALGOS "TRND","CNTR"
#define _TIMEFRAMES 60,240

function run()
{
  BarPeriod = 60;
  LookBack = 2000;

  assetLoop();

  if(strstr(Algo,"TRND"))
    tradeTrend();
  else if(strstr(Algo,"CNTR"))
    tradeCounterTrend();
}
```


If your script has no asset/algo loops, replace your first **asset()**
call with **assetLoop()**. Mind the **Algo** comparison with **strstr**. Using
**strcmp** or **'='** for algo selection would not
work
anymore, since algo names now get a number appended. If you start the system now, it assigns different colors to the variables
since it recognizes from their name to which algo they belong.


If you now run the system without loading a job, or if you select only a
single job , it will use the first asset, algo, and time frame from the
definitions. If multiple jobs are loaded, they will be trained and tested with
all their asset, algo, and time frame combinations.


 The Action menu now got the final item to
Create Algos from Summary. All profitable and robust
jobs from that summary with a CA result of 75% or better are selected for the
final portfolio. They are automatically loaded at start.
 

### Remarks


- Compare algo names not with **'='**, but with **
	strstr()**, as in the above example. First, it is needed because the
	algos generated by the shell get a number appended. Second, it is needed
	when you want to run your strategy with VC++. VC++ will give no error
	message when comparing strings with **'='**, but will just skip
	the clause.

- In a multi-algo portfolio, your run function
	is called multiple times at any bar. If you want something to be only
	executed once, like a start message, put it in a **main**
	function.
